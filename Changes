Revision history for Perl extension Math::Prime::Util::GMP

0.09  21 April 2013

    - Add primality certificate generation.

0.08   5 April 2013

    - Switch to a projective ECM with a stage 2.  Much better results, but
      note that it doesn't build up to B1 like the old version.  This has
      a big impact on factoring and primality proving.

    - Add a QS based on William Hart's SIMPQS (a simple QS that is a
      predecessor to what went into FLINT).  Not the fastest by a long shot
      (yafu and msieve take that prize), but it's quite small and works pretty
      well.  Eventually this will get replaced with a home-built QS.  Meanwhile
      some improvements from version 2.0 that remain are (1) no partial
      relations, (2) uses too much memory, and (3) uses GE instead of
      jasonp's block Lanczos.

    - The new ECM and QS make factoring much faster, especially for 30+
      digit inputs.  Factoring should give reasonable times out to 70+
      digits now.  Time is competitive with Math::Pari now, and often faster
      (noting that Math::Pari uses a fairly old version of Pari).

    - Factoring mix redone given the big changes in ECM and QS.

    - Primality proofs adjusted to better use p-1 and ECM.  The quick proof
      in is_prime has a higher success rate for all input sizes and is a
      little faster for small numbers.  is_provable_prime is 10-50x faster.

0.07  19 March 2013

    - Tiny speedup when passing in bigints.

    - Some speedups in pbrent, pbrent usage, and small prime iterator.
      Factoring small (< ~30 digit) numbers is faster.

    - Handle large and small M-R bases just like MPU does -- mod with n,
      then return 1 if base <= 1 or base >= n-1.

0.06  17 December 2012

    - Fix 1-byte memory overrun (thanks to CPAN Testers, Solaris, Valgrind).

    - Add factoring of small numbers.  Helps a little when the input gets
      reduced enough to fit into a UV.

0.05  15 December 2012

    - Add AKS primality test.  Super slow, but nice to have around.

    - ECM is faster.

    - Add a small prime iterator, which means _much_ less memory and faster
      operation for big smoothness factors in pminus1 and ecm factoring.

0.04  11 November 2012

    - Add simple prime_count function.  It uses next_prime so is terribly slow
      for big ranges.  However it's a lot faster than the PP code when given
      a large base and small range e.g. (10**96, 10**96 + 2**18).

    - Add primorial, pn_primorial, and consecutive_integer_lcm functions.

    - Factoring:
         Add a perfect power test.
         Add a simple ECM factoring method.
         Speed up SQUFOF a bit.
         Complete p-1 rewrite.  Much faster and finds more factors.
         Adjust general factor() mix.

    - Add Pocklington-Lehmer and BLS primality tests.  is_prime() uses the
      BLS test with a quick factoring attempt for numbers less than 2^200,
      though the chances of success drop off as the size increases.
      The point is not to cull mismarked probable primes (we use BPSW so this
      is highly unlikely for these small sizes), but to quickly mark more
      numbers as definitely prime.  Remember to use is_prob_prime if you do
      not care about this distinction and want the result slightly faster.

    - add is_provable_prime function that calls BLS with much more aggressive
      factoring.

0.03  16 July 2012
    - XS callable: _lcm_of_consecutive_integers(B)
      which is a better alternative for B! for many factoring algorithms.
    - Fix some minor compile issues.

0.02  15 July 2012
    - Factoring tests assumed 64-bit.  Rewrite.

0.01  15 July 2012
    - Initial release
