- ECM should add a stage 2.

- prime_count - needs the pc(#) option as well as pc(#,#)

- Consider adding Lehmer's method for prime count.  The only use I can really
  think of would be 32-bit machines.  I worry that the overhead of GMP would
  kill us, and some method using __uint64s, or even Math::Int64 would be
  faster.

- nth_prime

- We should have a native-int factoring module that works on any native-size
  composites.  Given that we'll already have done trial division, I'm thinking
  perhaps a good SQUFOF.

- GMP SQUFOF could use a better implementation, though low priority since it
  just isn't going to be the right algorithm for numbers > 2^64.  Mainly what
  it needs is to pay attention to the rounds argument.  Perhaps race.

- Add Riemann R function
